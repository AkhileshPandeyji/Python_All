"MiB is a feel-good action film with good effects, humor and a simple plot. If you go in expecting a good story it'll disappoint, but go in expecting just some simple time killing the fun, it's enjoyable enough.",1

"Avengers: Endgame (5 out of 5 stars).

Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent awesome superhero film that concludes the infinity stones storyline that has been building up with 22 movies in the Marvel universe. They had done a great job building up each solo character and have their films bring something new and exciting. Endgame is the game changer that delivers the ultimate climax of the story arc with the big bad Thanos (Josh Brolin) going up against the Avengers. After the previous film Infinity War leaving the audience hanging with the cliffhanger. Marvel has done a great job in marketing and keeping this film spoilers free with the trailers that only show the same footage and very minimum. Which I will say it is best to see the film knowing very little about what is going to happen.",1
"If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him, as well as Captain America and a few others, were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!",1

"From start to finish this is a complete mess and strays so far from the original. I don't mind enhancing the story and putting a new spin on it, but Guy Richie butchered it by changing it in every possible way.

The dialogue is painful and unnatural and the musical scenes are a mess.

Aside from Naomi Scott, the casting was terrible. The old wise character of Jafar was totally destroyed by Marwan Kenzari. One of the best characters in the original, Jafar's sidekick Iago, could barely talk and for some reason was turned into a monster in one of the many completely unnecessary scenes.

Basically unrecognizable from one of Disney's great original movies and a real shame. No idea why Disney allowed this mess to happen.",0
Bad Movie. It was ridiculous with low-quality cinematography.,0
"High ratings for this must be people who didn't watch Disney movies in the past. It's a hot mess, still can't believe it.",0
